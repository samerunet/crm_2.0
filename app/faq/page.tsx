  {
    q: 'How do I inquire and book?',
    a: 'Use the link below to share your date, getting-ready location, party size, and any links to inspiration. You’ll receive availability and a tailored quote. Once details are confirmed, a signed e-contract and retainer secure your date.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you require a retainer/deposit?',
    a: 'Yes. A retainer is required to reserve your date and is applied to your total. The retainer is non-refundable once the contract is signed, because the schedule is blocked for your party.',
  },
  {
    q: 'When should I book my wedding makeup?',
    a: 'Most brides book 6–12 months in advance, especially for peak seasons and popular Saturdays. If your date is sooner, still inquire—openings do happen.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer trials/preview appointments?',
    a: 'Yes. Trials are recommended 6–10 weeks before the wedding or key photos. We discuss your vision, lighting, wardrobe, and skincare so you see a refined, camera-ready look.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is included in a bridal makeup application?',
    a: 'Skin prep, complexion refinement, soft sculpting, eyes, brows, cheeks, lips, and individual or strip lashes if desired. Every look is tailored to your features and lighting.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer hair styling too?',
    a: 'Yes. Bridal hairstyle and touch-ups are available, and larger parties can be accommodated with an assistant. Hair services can be added to your proposal.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you travel on location? Are there travel fees?',
    a: 'Yes, on-site services are available throughout San Diego and beyond. Local travel is often included; extended mileage, early call times, parking, tolls, or destination travel will be itemized on your quote.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is there a minimum for on-location bookings?',
    a: 'Minimums may apply for peak dates, early mornings, and locations outside the core service area. Your quote will specify any minimums before you sign.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long should I plan per person?',
    a: 'Bridal makeup typically takes 60–75 minutes. Party members are 45–60 minutes each. Hair timing is similar. We build a calm, realistic timeline with your photographer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many people can you accommodate?',
    a: 'Large parties are welcome. We can add a licensed assistant to keep the morning smooth and on schedule. Let us know your final headcount early for staffing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you stay for touch-ups?',
    a: 'Yes. On-site touch-up or second-look coverage can be added by the hour. Many brides love a quick refresh before portraits and reception entrances.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Lashes, men’s grooming, and airbrush?',
    a: 'Lashes are available at no extra charge if desired. Men’s grooming and airbrush can be added upon request.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What products do you use? Are they photo-friendly?',
    a: 'We use a pro kit curated for longevity and photography: skin-prep, waterproof or water-resistant formulas, and textures that read beautifully in person and on camera. Ingredient-sensitive clients can request alternatives.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How should I prep my skin for the appointment?',
    a: 'Hydrate well, avoid new treatments within a week of your event, and arrive with clean, moisturized skin. If you are unsure, we’ll recommend a simple prep plan at trial.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you work with all skin tones and ages?',
    a: 'Yes. The kit is stocked for every undertone and depth, and the application approach adapts to texture, sensitivity, and mature skin.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is your cancellation or reschedule policy?',
    a: 'Because your date is reserved and other work is declined, retainers are non-refundable. Reschedules are handled case-by-case based on availability and contract terms.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do payments work?',
    a: 'Retainer at signing; remaining balance is due by the deadline in your contract. We accept cash, Zelle, or Venmo. Invoices and receipts are provided.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you provide contracts and invoices?',
    a: 'Yes. You’ll receive a digital contract for e-signature and itemized invoices for the retainer, trial, and remaining balance. Your planner can be CC’d on paperwork if you prefer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer destination weddings or editorial/on-set work?',
    a: 'Absolutely. We travel for weddings and creative productions. Travel logistics, per-diem, and accommodations (if applicable) will be included in your proposal.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you teach lessons or offer guides?',
    a: 'Yes—private lessons and online guides are available so you can recreate key steps at home. Ask about current offerings.',
  },
